PrimeImplicantSolver
====================

Solves for Prime Implicants given the number of input variables and minterms

Inspiration: For my Advanced Logic Design class, I was frustrated with solving for the prime implicants of a truth table by hand. I became even more frustrated when I could not find a solver online. So I made one in Java. Feel free to use the code. Please credit me if you do.
